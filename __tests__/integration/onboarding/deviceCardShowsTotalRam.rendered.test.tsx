/**
 * RENDERED (UI integration) — onboarding "Your Device" card shows TOTAL physical RAM.
 *
 * REGRESSION (shipped in 0.0.103): the card labelled "Available Memory" rendered
 * deviceInfo.availableMemory, which the memory-budget rework changed to the per-process
 * allocatable ceiling (os_proc_available_memory) — a small number that reads as a wrong
 * device spec. On the reported device with 11GB total but a ~4.57GB process ceiling, the card showed
 * "4.57 GB" as if that were the phone's memory.
 *
 * SPEC (OGAM user's view): the "Your Device" card shows the device's TOTAL RAM — the number
 * the user recognises and the same one the model recommendations gate on (getTotalMemoryGB).
 * The per-process ceiling is a budget input, never surfaced here.
 *
 * BOUNDARY: 11GB Android device whose process-available snapshot is 4.57GB. RED before the fix:
 * card shows "4.57 GB". GREEN after: it shows "11.00 GB" and never "4.57 GB".
 *
 * Real ModelDownloadScreen + real hardwareService/appStore; fakes ONLY at the native RAM sensor
 * (installNativeBoundary). NEVER mocks our own code.
