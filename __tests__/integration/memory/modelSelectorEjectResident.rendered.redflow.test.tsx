/**
 * TDD (feature not built yet) — per-model eject in the model selector.
 *
 * The model selector should list EVERY model currently in memory (text, image, and sidecars like whisper),
 * each with its RAM, and let the user eject each one INDIVIDUALLY — freeing only that model (calling its real
 * unload), leaving the others resident. This is the "In Memory" section. It also lets a user free the whisper
 * sidecar that ejectAll leaks (T023b).
 *
 * State reached through REAL interactions (no register() shortcut): setupChatScreen loads a text model via the
 * Home picker; loadImageModel loads an image model (which evicts the text model — one heavy at a time); a real
 * whisper download+select makes whisper co-resident. So getResidents() ends at image + whisper.
 *
 * These assertions FAIL today (the section + evict-by-key don't exist). They are the spec the feature satisfies.
