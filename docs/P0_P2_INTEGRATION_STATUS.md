# App-wide P0-P3 integration risk inventory

This is the living, conservative evidence audit for the whole app. Product
screens, navigation, services, stores, persistence, lifecycle behavior, native
boundaries, and Pro extension seams define the scope. The canonical
`docs/RELEASE_TEST_CHECKLIST.csv` is one traceability source, not the boundary of
the inventory. A row is credited only after its real rendered/native journey has
been mapped, rerun, and shown to prove the user-visible behavior. An audit-pending
row does **not** mean that no test exists.

## Summary

- Current scope: **244 journeys** - **33 P0**, **117 P1**, **84 P2**, and **10 P3**.
- Release-checklist traceability contributes 196 rows; the app-derived inventory
  currently contributes 48 additional journeys, including the first P3 set.
- P0: **18 verified**, **10 partial/device-gated**, **0 confirmed gaps**, **5 audit pending**.
- P1: **12 verified**, **1 partial/device-gated**, **44 confirmed gaps**, **60 audit pending**.
- P2: **4 verified**, **0 partial/device-gated**, **26 confirmed gaps**, **54 audit pending**.
- P3: **0 verified**, **0 partial/device-gated**, **0 confirmed gaps**, **10 audit pending**.
- `[x]` verified; `[~]` automated portion verified with a physical-device gate left; `[ ]` confirmed coverage gap; `[?]` evidence audit pending.
- This file is updated as journeys are verified or product fixes land.

## Priority model

- **P0:** app availability, security boundary, irreversible data loss, or the core
  offline model/download/chat path is unusable.
- **P1:** a primary workflow is broken, state becomes inconsistent, or a common
  failure cannot recover without reinstalling or losing work.
- **P2:** a secondary workflow, management surface, or uncommon recovery path is
  broken but the core app remains usable.
- **P3:** polish, accessibility, layout, scale, and rare interaction edges that do
  not corrupt data or block the main workflow.

## App-derived additions beyond the release checklist

### P0 additions

- [x] APP-P0-001 Corrupt persisted app settings do not trap startup or wipe unrelated user data
- [?] APP-P0-002 Persisted schema migrations retain chats, projects, models, and settings across old versions
- [?] APP-P0-003 Partial database or filesystem initialization failure still reaches a recoverable screen
- [?] APP-P0-004 Interrupted persistence writes do not erase previously committed chats or projects
- [?] APP-P0-005 Lock state cannot be bypassed by cold start, background resume, or direct navigation
- [?] APP-P0-006 Pro extension load failure cannot crash or disable the core app

### P1 additions

- [?] APP-P1-001 Cancelling a running download removes only that transfer and leaves a retriable state
- [?] APP-P1-002 Cancelling a queued download prevents it from resurrecting after relaunch
- [?] APP-P1-003 Repeated download taps coalesce to one native transfer and one visible row
- [?] APP-P1-004 Foreground download hydration deduplicates native, persisted, and newer in-memory state
- [?] APP-P1-005 Deleting the active resident model unloads it and selects a coherent fallback
- [?] APP-P1-006 Local model import accepts a compatible file and rejects incompatible or partial files clearly
- [?] APP-P1-007 Missing or corrupt downloaded files self-heal the model list without a phantom ready model
- [?] APP-P1-008 Create, rename, open, and delete conversations preserve the correct active chat
- [?] APP-P1-009 Attachments are copied durably and a missing attachment after relaunch fails gracefully
- [?] APP-P1-010 Context compaction persists its summary without dropping recent messages
- [?] APP-P1-011 Gallery deletion removes the file and updates the grid without stale thumbnails
- [?] APP-P1-012 Deleting a KB document removes its index and prevents stale retrieval
- [?] APP-P1-013 Replacing or re-indexing a KB document cannot mix old and new chunks
- [?] APP-P1-014 Add, edit, delete, and switch remote servers recover active model selection coherently
- [?] APP-P1-015 Remote authentication failures are actionable and never expose credentials in UI or logs
- [?] APP-P1-016 Pro activation registers routes live; entitlement revocation removes gated behavior safely
- [x] APP-P1-017 Experimental MTP defaults off, persists explicitly, and never changes ordinary GGUF behavior
- [?] APP-P1-018 Background locking and unlock preserve the current conversation without exposing its content

### P2 additions

- [?] APP-P2-001 Model search, filters, and tabs retain coherent results through downloads and deletion
- [?] APP-P2-002 Home and chat model pickers show the same active, downloaded, and resident state
- [?] APP-P2-003 Download Manager cancel, retry, queued, processing, and terminal states expose valid actions
- [?] APP-P2-004 Orphaned-file cleanup never removes a downloaded, active, or in-flight model file
- [?] APP-P2-005 Cache clearing updates storage totals and preserves user conversations and models
- [?] APP-P2-006 Tool enablement and disablement persist and affect only subsequent turns
- [?] APP-P2-007 MCP servers reconnect after relaunch without duplicate clients, tools, or routes
- [?] APP-P2-008 MCP OAuth cancel, expiry, refresh, and retry return to an actionable state
- [?] APP-P2-009 LAN discovery deduplicates repeated scans and supports multiple configured servers
- [?] APP-P2-010 Supported document types import and preview with stable names and metadata
- [?] APP-P2-011 Every Settings card opens its registered screen and returns without losing tab state
- [?] APP-P2-012 External community and support links fail gracefully when no handler is available
- [?] APP-P2-013 Debug logs can be viewed, exported, and cleared without leaking secrets
- [?] APP-P2-014 Dynamic Pro settings and screen registration stays deduplicated across refresh and reactivation

### P3 additions

- [?] APP-P3-001 Primary controls expose meaningful accessibility roles, names, values, and disabled state
- [?] APP-P3-002 Screen-reader focus order and progress announcements follow the visible workflow
- [?] APP-P3-003 Dynamic type does not clip critical actions, alerts, settings values, or message controls
- [?] APP-P3-004 Keyboard, safe-area, and bottom-sheet transitions never hide the composer or confirmation actions
- [?] APP-P3-005 Small-phone and tablet layouts keep navigation, cards, modals, and previews usable
- [?] APP-P3-006 Rapid repeated taps on send, retry, delete, load, and record remain idempotent
- [?] APP-P3-007 Long model, project, document, server, and conversation names wrap or truncate accessibly
- [?] APP-P3-008 Large chat, model, project, and gallery collections remain responsive and scroll correctly
- [?] APP-P3-009 Light, dark, and system themes preserve readable contrast across alerts and transient states
- [?] APP-P3-010 Back gestures during loading, recording, generation, and modal presentation clean up safely
