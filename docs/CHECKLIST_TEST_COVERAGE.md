# P0/P1 integration coverage roadmap

This is the critical-behavior ledger for `docs/RELEASE_TEST_CHECKLIST.csv`. It replaces the former
ledger that counted deleted direct-screen, mocked-navigation, and store-manufactured tests as UI
coverage.

## Honest baseline

- Canonical critical rows: **126** — **27 P0** and **99 P1**.
- A checked row requires a real `App`/navigation journey driven by user gestures and visible
  assertions. Native/OS-only behavior additionally requires XCTest, JUnit, or the release-device gate.
- Current automated critical coverage: **39 complete rows** plus **8 partial device rows**. Test counts
  and line coverage are not substitutes for this journey ledger.
- Supporting pure-function or component contracts may remain useful, but they do not check a row here.

Legend: `[x]` real-App journey exists; `[~]` automated portion exists but a physical-device action is
still required; `[ ]` critical journey is open.

## P0 — release-blocking journeys (27)

### Install

- [~] #1 Fresh install launches — empty-storage App journey exists; physical install remains required.
- [x] #195 Boot is independent of download database recovery.

### Downloads

- [x] #4 Download a text (GGUF) model.
- [x] #9 Download an STT (Whisper) model.
- [x] #11 Download a TTS voice model.
- [~] #18 Interrupted download recovers after relaunch — Android/STT and iOS lost-row recovery render
  retriable cards after simulated relaunch; a physical force-kill remains required.

### Text generation

- [x] #23 First message lazily loads and replies with a GGUF model.
- [x] #42 Failed generation clears the spinner and renders an error.
- [x] #43 Stop mid-generation keeps partial output and restores input.

### Voice

- [~] #53 Chat-mode dictation reaches the composer with GGUF — the real ChatScreen hold gesture and
  transcript render are automated; physical microphone capture remains required.
- [~] #54 Chat-mode dictation reaches the composer with LiteRT — the direct-audio recording path renders
  its transcript in the real composer; physical microphone capture remains required.
- [~] #55 A chat voice note carries transcript, never raw model audio — the reviewed transcript sends as
  visible text from the real composer; physical microphone capture remains required.
- [~] #60 Full voice journey: STT -> model reply -> TTS — real-screen calculator and image voice journeys
  exercise routing, generation, tool results, and audio bubbles; audible device playback remains required.

### Image

- [x] #66 Image generation renders the generated image.

### Memory and residency

- [x] #85 Loading mode is selectable, shared by both surfaces, and persists.
- [x] #86 Downloading Whisper does not make it resident.
- [x] #87 Conservative mode keeps one heavy model resident.
- [x] #88 Balanced mode co-resides heavy models when they fit.
- [x] #93 Idle STT is reclaimed for a text turn.
- [x] #99 Oversized model shows a graceful memory card.
- [~] #101 Load Anyway follows the explicit override path — the real button overrides the refusal and
  renders the generated image; physical-device jetsam/OOM survival remains an accepted-risk device gate.

### Persistence and release

- [x] #167 Chat history survives relaunch.
- [x] #168 Downloaded models survive relaunch.
- [x] #171 Download entries survive relaunch.
- [ ] #180 Gemma-4 native-first thinking + tool journey.
- [x] #181 Upgrade-over-install keeps data and Aggressive loading mode on a physical Android 16 device.
- [ ] #187 Queued downloads survive app kill and resume.

## Removed count inflation

- The pure LiteRT router behavior now lives under `unit/services`.
- The direct-store reasoning render duplicated narrower grammar/parser contracts and was removed.
- The synthetic share-prompt host duplicated the scheduler and sheet contracts and was removed.
- The direct-store image-settings suite was removed; its reset/parity behavior remains an open real-App
  journey and does not count as integration coverage.
