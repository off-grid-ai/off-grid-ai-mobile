/**
 * T033 / DEV-B14 — while a local (llama/gguf) model is still streaming its <think> reasoning, that reasoning
 * renders in the THINKING BLOCK from the first token — NOT dumped into the answer bubble until the </think>
 * close (the device bug: "the entire thinking phase renders in the ANSWER bubble until the close delimiter,
 * then retroactively reclassifies" — part6/7, on a gguf model → engine:'llama').
 *
 * The bug is only observable MID-STREAM, so the llama fake streams char-by-char and is PAUSED deep inside the
 * still-open <think> (pauseAfter lands well before </think>). The mid-stream render is asserted, then released.
 *
 * GREEN on HEAD (B14 fixed): mid-<think>, the reasoning is in the thinking block and the answer has NOT leaked
 * it. Falsified against the real lever (parseThinkTags' <think> detection): break it → the reasoning leaks
 * into the answer, the thinking block loses it → red.
