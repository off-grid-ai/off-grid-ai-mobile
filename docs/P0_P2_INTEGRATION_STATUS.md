# P0-P2 integration status

This is the living, conservative status for the canonical `docs/RELEASE_TEST_CHECKLIST.csv`.
A row is credited only when a real rendered/native journey proves the user-visible behavior.

## Summary

- Canonical scope: **196 journeys** - **27 P0**, **99 P1**, and **70 P2**.
- The canonical checklist currently contains **no P3 rows**.
- P0: **18 covered**, **7 partial/device-gated**, **2 not yet credited**.
- P1: **8 covered**, **0 partial/device-gated**, **91 not yet credited**.
- P2: **0 covered**, **0 partial/device-gated**, **70 not yet credited**.
- `[x]` covered; `[~]` automated portion covered with a physical-device gate left; `[ ]` confirmed open; `[?]` evidence audit pending.
- This file is updated as journeys are verified or product fixes land.
