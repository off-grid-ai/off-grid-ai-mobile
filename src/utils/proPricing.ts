/**
 * Off Grid AI Pro pricing copy, shared by every Pro surface so they stay in sync.

 * Two plans only: a yearly subscription and a one-time lifetime purchase. The price is
 * a founder rate that only ever goes up as we grow, so the numbers are hardcoded to
 * today's tier and bumped in a new release when a tier fills. The web pay page
 * (getoffgridai.co/pay) is where checkout happens and holds the authoritative price.
